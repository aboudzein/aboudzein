Hi there! 🙋‍♂️ My name is Abdurahman Zeineddin, and I am excited to share a little bit about myself with you. I am passionate about 🏗️ solution architecture, 📱 product development, and 💻 technology. I love learning new things, and I am always looking for ways to improve and grow. In my free time, I enjoy reading 📚 books, researching new ideas, and collaborating with others. I am also a huge fan of e-sports, and I enjoy spending time in the open source community. Additionally, I am passionate about economics, physics, maths, and helping others, and always looking for ways to create a friendly and supportive environment. Overall, I am a curious person, and I am always looking for new opportunities to learn and share my knowledge.

As a 🧑‍💼 solution architect, I have experience working with 🌩️ Google Cloud Native Apps, ⛅️ AWS Native Apps, and implementing infrastructure from A-Z. I am proficient in using 🐍 python and C# as my main programming languages, and I am also experienced in using typescript. My focus is on building scalable and high-performance solutions, and I have been on this journey for a 🕙 long time. On GitHub, I have contributed to a variety of projects and have gained experience in both frontend and backend development. I am always looking for new opportunities to learn and collaborate with others, and I am excited to continue growing and sharing my knowledge on GitHub or any other platform.

As someone who is passionate about both reading and programming, I have read many books in the solution architect field that have inspired and informed my work. Some of my favorites include:
